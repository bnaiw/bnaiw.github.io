<h3>New Tags and Elements Added:</h3>
<p> I added a powder blue border around the first heading and changed the background color to alice blue.
    Also, I changed my font-style, padding, and text-transform for my h1 to uppercase.
    Additionally, I changed the body of my background color to bisque.
    I highlighted some of my text in light pink. I added a picture as well as a red border as you all see above.
    I practiced adding a link which directs you to the Google homepage. I used the following tags: heading level tags; paragraph tags;
     and strong emphasized tag, 
    to name a few.
